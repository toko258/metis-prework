# Map Reduce Challenges


### The "hello world" of map reduce:

Write a mapper and reducer in Python to do word count. Test with a small simple file without Hadoop, and then try it on Hadoop. You might grab text from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).


### A slightly more interesting map reduce:

Write a mapper and reducer in Python to produce an outer join of the data in [data.txt](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum/tree/master/challenges/challenges_data/data.txt) by `name`.
