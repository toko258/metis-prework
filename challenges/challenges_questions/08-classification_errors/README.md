### Classification Error Metric Challenges

**Settings:  Where applicable, use test_size=0.30, random_state=4444.  This will permit comparison of results across users.

*These reference the Classification Challenges.*


#### Challenge 1

For the house representatives data set, calculate the accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores of each classifier you built (on the test set).


#### Challenge 2

For each, draw the ROC curve and calculate the AUC.


#### Challenge 3

Calculate the same metrics you did in challenge 1, but this time in a cross validation scheme with the `cross_val_score` function (like in Challenge 9).


#### Challenge 4

For your movie classifiers, calculate the precision and recall for each class.


#### Challenge 5

Draw the ROC curve (and calculate AUC) for the logistic regression classifier from challenge 12.
