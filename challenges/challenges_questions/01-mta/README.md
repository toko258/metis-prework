# Benson Challenges

#### Challenge 1   
  
- Open up a new IPython notebook
- Download a few MTA turnstile data files
- Load the files into a pandas DataFrame (hint: `pd.read_csv()` to load files and `pd.concat()` to combine DataFrames)

Your dataframe should look something like this:


|    | C/A   | UNIT   | SCP      | STATION   | LINENAME   | DIVISION   | DATE       | TIME     | DESC    |   ENTRIES |   EXITS                                                                |
|---:|:------|:-------|:---------|:----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:---------|:--------|----------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  0 | A002  | R051   | 02-00-00 | 59 ST     | NQR456     | BMT        | 08/27/2016 | 00:00:00 | REGULAR |   5799442 |                                                                1966041 |
|  1 | A002  | R051   | 02-00-00 | 59 ST     | NQR456     | BMT        | 08/27/2016 | 04:00:00 | REGULAR |   5799463 |                                                                1966044 |
|  2 | A002  | R051   | 02-00-00 | 59 ST     | NQR456     | BMT        | 08/27/2016 | 08:00:00 | REGULAR |   5799492 |                                                                1966079 |
|  3 | A002  | R051   | 02-00-00 | 59 ST     | NQR456     | BMT        | 08/27/2016 | 12:00:00 | REGULAR |   5799610 |                                                                1966155 |
|  4 | A002  | R051   | 02-00-00 | 59 ST     | NQR456     | BMT        | 08/27/2016 | 16:00:00 | REGULAR |   5799833 |                                                                1966214 |


#### Challenge 2

- Let's turn this into a time series.

- Our pandas dataframe has columns called `Date` and `Time` (what datatype did pandas assign to these columns on import?), however in python and pandas we can convert date and time information to _datetime_ objects, which allow us to do time-based operations

- Using either [pd.to_datetime](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html) in pandas or the [python datetime library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html), combine the `Date` and `Time` columns into a single new column of the datetime datatype


#### Challenge 3

- Each row is a turnstile, identified by a combination of  the `C/A`, `UNIT`, `SCP`, and `STATION` columns, with information on entries and exits at that turnstile every n hours. (What is n?) We want total daily entries. 
- Group the data so that it represents **daily entries** for each turnstile (hint: `pd.groupby` or `DataFrame.groupby`)


#### Challenge 4

We will plot the daily time series for a single turnstile.

In ipython notebook, add this to the beginning of your next cell:
```
    %matplotlib inline
```
This will make your matplotlib graphs integrate nicely with the
notebook. 

To plot the time series, import matplotlib with
```
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- Select one turnstile (combination of [`C/A`, `UNIT`, `SCP`, `STATION`])
- Filter your pandas DataFrame so it only represents a single turnstile (make sure that turnstile has entries for multiple days).
- Using matplotlib, create a plot with the days on the X axis and the daily entries for that turnstile on the Y axis

You can use the following as a starting point:
```
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))
    plt.plot(<days>,<entries>)
```
#### Challenge 5

- So far we've been operating on a single turnstile level, let's
  combine turnstiles in the same ControlArea/Unit/Station combo. There
  are some ControlArea/Unit/Station groups that have a single
  turnstile, but most have multiple turnstiles-- same value for the
  C/A, UNIT and STATION columns, different values for the SCP column.

We want to combine the numbers together -- for each
ControlArea/UNIT/STATION combo, for each day, sum the counts from each
turnstile belonging to that combo. (hint: `pd.groupby`)


#### Challenge 6

Similarly, combine everything in each station, and come up with **daily** time
series for each STATION, by adding up all the turnstiles in a station.


#### Challenge 7

Plot the daily time series for a station.


#### Challenge 8

- Make one list of counts for **one** week for one station. Monday's
count, Tuesday's count, etc. so it's a list of 7 counts.
Make the same list for another week, and another week, and another
week. (hint: [pandas datetime day of week](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.dayofweek.html#pandas.Series.dt.dayofweek) may be useful)

`plt.plot(week_count_list)` for every `week_count_list` you created
this way. You should get a rainbow plot of weekly commute numbers on
top of each other.


#### Challenge 9

- Over multiple weeks, sum total ridership for each station and sort
  them, so you can find out the stations with the highest traffic
  during the time you investigate


#### Challenge 10

- Make a single list of these total ridership values and plot it with

    plt.hist(total_ridership_counts)

to get an idea about the distribution of total ridership among
different stations.

This should show you that most stations have a small traffic, and the
histogram bins for large traffic volumes have small bars.

*Additional Hint*:

If you want to see which stations take the meat of the traffic, you
can sort the total ridership counts and make a `plt.bar` graph. For
this, you want to have two lists: the indices of each bar, and the
values. The indices can just be `0,1,2,3,...`, so you can do

    indices = range(len(total_ridership_values))
    plt.bar(indices, total_ridership_values)
