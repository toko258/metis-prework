# Wiki Golf Pair problem

Have you ever heard of [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)? It's like regular golf but with less grass and more typing. In regular golf you try to get a golfball into a hole using as few strokes as possible. Code golf is exactly the same! Except you're trying to write code that does something using as few *key* strokes as possible. (Get it??)

Really, instead of counting keystrokes we usually count characters in the final program.

# Miniwiki code golf challenge

I made a wiki called miniwiki and the code for it lives in `miniwiki.py`. you can run it with

```bash
python miniwiki.py
```

It's really cool! It displays pages and allows anyone to edit them in markdown. If you visit a page that doesn't exist, it automatically generates that page.

I'm really proud of what I've done but it's still quite long.

I'd like for you to see if you can take my wiki as a starting point and make it competitive in the [Shortest Wiki Contest](http://wiki.c2.com/?ShortestWikiContest).

## Your job

For the pair problem I'll want you to:
1. Implement backlinks so that it meets the [Four Wiki Principles](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiPrinciples) required by the Shortest Wiki Contest.
2. Get the code under 1,000 characters. You can test this in the command line with, for example, `wc -c miniwiki.py`
3. See which group can get the code to be the shortest while still meeting the four principles. I've heard that you can do this in python with <400 characters!
