    "### The Monty Hall Problem\n",

    "You can read more about the background and fascinating history of the problem on the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now this is what you need to know: There was a game show called Let's Make a Deal. The idea was simple: there are three doors; behind one of the doors is a car (apparently desirable) and behind two of the doors were goats (apparently not so desirable). \n",
    "\n",
    "Play would then proceed in this way: \n",
    "* The player chooses a door (1, 2 or 3) that they think the car is behind\n",
    "* Monty Hall, the host, opens one of the two doors that the player has NOT selected and reveals a goat (remember, two of the doors have a goat, so whether the player picked a car or a goat, Monty has at least one door he can open)\n",
    "* The player, after seeing which door has been opened and shown to have a goat, gets to decide whether they want to stick with their original choice of door or whether they want to switch\n",
    "\n",
    "The question here is: **Does switching your guess for the door with a car after seeing which one Monty opens improve your odds of winning the car?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about this a bit. Some people originally thought that no, switching wouldn't help: after all, there are still three doors and so the probability of a car being behind any of them is 1/3 the whole time. Others thought that seeing the opened door with a goat is information that changes the probabilities (updating via Bayes' theorem). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** Simulate the game. If you have time at the end, also try to solve it analytically using Bayes' theorem. To simulate it, this is what you'll need to do: \n",
    "* For each simulation, pick a winning door (out of 1, 2 or 3)\n",
    "* Randomly choose a door for the player \n",
    "* Keep a running tally of wins from switching vs not switching: for each simulation, look at the player's door and Monty's door and record whether the player would have won from staying OR switching\n",
    "* Run the simulation many times and record the proportion of cases where a player wins from switching\n",
    "* Plot the output from the simulation \n"
