# Investigations

Starting week 4, each student will create a 10 minute presentation on a topic that is related to data science, but that we don't cover in the bootcamp. You can either present a presentation deck or walk through code.

We encourage you to pick a topic you're interested in because this is your opportunity to dedicate some time to a deep dive. Please chat with an instructor a week prior to your investigation to confirm your topic.
